### Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning

**Project Description:**
Developed an end-to-end machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease using a dataset containing various voice and speech features. The dataset used for this project is publicly available on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons) and includes recordings from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease. The project involved extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation to accurately identify individuals with Parkinson's disease based on their voice characteristics.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaned and preprocessed the raw voice and speech data to handle missing values and outliers.
  - Standardized and scaled the features to ensure uniformity across different attributes.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Selected relevant features related to voice characteristics, such as fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR).
  - Conducted correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction techniques like [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html) and [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) to identify key predictors.

- **Model Development:**
  - Implemented and compared various machine learning algorithms including [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html), [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html), [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html), [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html), [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html), and [Neural Networks](https://keras.io/api/models/model/).
  - Developed a deep neural network architecture using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) to capture complex patterns in the data.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve ([AUC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.auc.html)).
  - Employed cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of the models to unseen data.

- **Optimization and Tuning:**
  - Tuned hyperparameters for each model to optimize performance and avoid overfitting.
  - Applied techniques like ensemble learning and early stopping to improve model efficiency and convergence.

**Dataset Information:**
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons)
- **Attributes:** The dataset contains 195 records and 23 attributes, including voice measures and clinical status. The attributes include fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR), and various others.

**Technologies Used:**
